# Rino Godson | Portfolio

This is my simple portfolio website with a cool UI. I designed it with a blend of Nothing's design style and New York Times style typography.

I used Next.js for this project, and from this point on, I'm a Next.js hater. It's too opinionated, sometimes buggy, and honestly just frustrating. I should've used React instead, but I chose Next.js for the SSR—only to be told "no server components inside client ones." Classic.

The best part of this site is probably the mobile UI: an Apple liquid-glass–inspired navigation section (subtle) and very nice animations.

> I got my domain, rinogodson.com, through Hack Club, and hosted the site on Netlify.
